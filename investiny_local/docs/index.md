# 🤏🏻 `investiny` is `investpy` but made tiny

**`investiny` is faster, lighter, and easier to use** than `investpy`.

`investiny` has been created due to the latest Investing.com changes in their API protection protocols, as 
now their main APIs are Cloudflare V2 protected. Anyway, there are still some APIs working fine, so this package
has been created as a temporary replacement for `investpy` while we get to an agreement to continue the development
of `investpy`. In the meantime, anyone can use `investiny` as I'm actively working on it, and ideally, it should support
most of the functionality provided by `investpy`.
